# Slate Mini Map
Adds a MiniMap widget that can display a Mini Map Texture/Brush.  
This is meant as a starting point to build a minimap widget for a project I am working on.

The MiniMap will automatically scroll with the owning players location.  
MiniMap radius and zoom level are required to be specified by the user.  
Whereas the radius should correspond to the Ortho Width of the Scene Capture that was used to capture the Mini Map texture.
